# ðŸš— **Power Platform Parking Challenge Solution**
# **Overview**

This repository contains my submission for the Microsoft Power Up Challengeâ€”a real-world scenario addressing parking management at Contoso High School, built using the Microsoft Power Platform suite. The solution delivers robust parking request management, daily inspections, automated notifications, and actionable analytics, all within a scalable, extensible low-code framework.
# ðŸŒŸ **Project Brief**

Contoso High School faced increasing complaints about parking availability from both staff and visitors. To address this, the leadership team required a solution to:

Allow daily parking requests from staff and visitors

Enable a parking inspector to log parked vehicles at 5PM daily

Provide insights to reduce unauthorized parking and optimize parking management
